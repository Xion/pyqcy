=====

*pyqcy* [pyksi:] is an automated testing framework for Python
inspired by the wonderful *QuickCheck* library for Haskell.

What's the idea?
----------------

Instead of writing fully-fledged test cases, with *pyqcy*
you simply define logical **properties** that your code
is expected to satisfy. Based on that, *pyqcy* will
automatically generate test cases for you - hundreds of them,
in fact!

How does it look like?
----------------------

For starters, try this::

    from pyqcy import qc, int_, main

    @qc
    def addition_actually_works(
        x=int_(min=0), y=int_(min=0)
    ):
        the_sum = x + y
        assert the_sum >= x and the_sum >= y

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

::

    $ pip install pyqcy
    $ python test.py
    addition_actually_works: passed 100 tests.

*pyqcy* generated 100 test cases and checked whether
they all pass. For a few lines of code, that's rather nice,
isn't it? :)

Of course, you are not limited to integers - there is
built-in support for all standard types, including lists
and dictionaries. Custom classes can be used as well:
just specify how to generate an *@arbitrary* object
of your class, and you're set.

Hey, I like it!
